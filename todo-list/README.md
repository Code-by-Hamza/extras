# Todo List Application

A simple command-line Todo List application written in Python. This app allows you to manage your daily tasks by viewing, adding, removing, and saving them to a file.

## Features
- **View Tasks:** Display all your current tasks.
- **Add Tasks:** Add new tasks to your list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Delete tasks by their number.
- **Save & Exit:** Save your tasks to `tasks.txt` and exit the program.

## How to Use
1. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python todo.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen menu to manage your tasks:
   - Enter `1` to view tasks.
   - Enter `2` to add a new task.
   - Enter `3` to remove a task by its number.
   - Enter `4` to save your tasks and exit.

## Data Storage
- Tasks are saved in a file named `tasks.txt` in the same directory as the script.
- If `tasks.txt` does not exist, it will be created automatically.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
